# üì• Bulk Downloader for Reddit

Downloads reddit posts. Made by [u/aliparlakci](https://reddit.com/u/aliparlakci)
  
Please give feedback *(errors, feature requests, etc.)* on the [Issues](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit/issues) page. I will try to resolve them ASAP.

## [Download the latest release here](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit/releases/latest)

## üöÄ How to use
If you run **Windows**, after you extract the zip file, double-click on the *bulk-downloader-for-reddit.exe*. The program will guide you through. Also, take a look at the [Setting up the program](#üî®-setting-up-the-program) section. **However**, Bulk Dowloader for Reddit has a plenty of features which can only be activated via command line arguments. See [Options](#‚öô-Options) for it.

Unfortunately, there is no binary for **MacOS** or **Linux**. If you are a MacOS or Linux user, you must use the program from the source code. See the [Interpret from source code](docs/INTERPRET_FROM_SOURCE.md) page.
  
However, binary version for Linux is being worked. So, stay tuned.
  
OR, regardless of your operating system, you can fire up the program from the **source code**.

### `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### `python3 script.py`

See the [Interpret from source code](docs/INTERPRET_FROM_SOURCE.md) page for more information.

## üî® Setting up the program
### üìΩ ffmpeg Library
  
Program needs **ffmpeg software** to add audio to some video files. However, installing it is **voluntary**. Although the program can still run with no errors without the ffmpeg library, some video files might have no sound.
  
Install it through a package manager such as **Chocolatey** in Windows, **apt** in Linux or **Homebrew** in MacOS:

- **in Windows**: After you **[install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)**, type **`choco install ffmpeg`** in either Command Promt or Powershell.
- **in Linux**: Type **`sudo apt install ffmpeg`** in Terminal.
- **in MacOS**: After you **[install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**, type **`brew install ffmpeg`** in Terminal

OR, [Download ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) manually on your system and [add the bin folder in the downloaded folder's directory to `PATH` of your system.](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) However, package manager option is suggested.

## üêã Docker
There is also a complete ready to go Docker integration. Install **Docker** and **docker-compose**. Then run the following command from the repository root:
### `docker-compose run --service-ports bdfr`
And you'll find youself right in the app. The files will be downloaded to `downloads/`. Since it is docker, you may want to change the ownership of the files once you're done (belongs to root by default).

## ‚ùî FAQ

### I am running the script on a headless machine or on a remote server. How can I authenticate my reddit account?
- Download the script on your everday computer and run it for once.
- Authenticate the program on both reddit and imgur.
- Go to your Home folder (for Windows users it is `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\`, for Linux users it is `/home/[USERNAME]`)
- Copy the *config.json* file inside the Bulk Downloader for Reddit folder and paste it **next to** the file that you run the program.

### How can I change my credentials?
- All of the user data is held in **config.json** file which is in a folder named "Bulk Downloader for Reddit" in your **Home** directory. You can edit them, there.  

  Also if you already have a config.json file, you can paste it **next to** the script and override the one on your Home directory. 

### What do the dots resemble when getting posts?
- Each dot means that 100 posts are scanned.

### Getting posts takes too long.
- You can press *Ctrl+C* to interrupt it and start downloading.

### How do I open self post files?
- Self posts are held at reddit as styled with markdown. So, the script downloads them as they are in order not to lose their stylings.
  However, there is a [great Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk) for viewing Markdown files with its styling. Install it and open the files with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/tr/chrome/).  

  However, they are basically text files. You can also view them with any text editor such as Notepad on Windows, gedit on Linux or Text Editor on MacOS.
